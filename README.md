Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with expertise in multiple programming languages. I specialise in backend development, blockchain development using Haskell and Plutus for Cardano, and AI projects utilising Python.

Over the years, I've gained experience working with Golang, which is one of my favorite programming languages for backend development. 

My interest in blockchain technology led me to Haskell and Plutus, and I'm excited to be part of the Cardano development community. I enjoy using my knowledge of functional programming to build smart contracts and decentralized applications that are both reliable and secure.

Overall, I'm passionate about technology and always striving to improve my skills and knowledge. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.
